In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my first five projects from this Techdegree.

I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Node.js and Express to:

- Import the required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to serve the project
